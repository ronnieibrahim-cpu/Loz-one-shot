# Art backlog

Work that is identified, scoped and not done. Each entry says what blocks it.

## Dungeon map rips (P7.5) — BLOCKED ON ASSETS

P7.5 is written against four Oracle of Seasons dungeon map rips: **Ancient
Ruins, Explorer's Crypt, Poison Moth's Lair and Dancing Dragon Dungeon**. They
are not in `assets/sheets/`. Everything in P7.5 that depends on them is
therefore not done:

- **The colour-register decision** (steps 1–3). See docs/ART-DIRECTION.md,
  "The colour register of the sheets" — the evidence that can be gathered
  without the maps is recorded there, and it is not enough to decide on. This
  is explicitly the user's call, not a session's.
- **Tiledefs for those four dungeons** (step 8). Nothing to derive them from.
- Their entries in `MAPS` at the top of `tools/rip-dungeon-maps.py`. Adding
  them is the only change the tool needs once the files land.

## What P7.5 DID land

`tools/rip-dungeon-maps.py` exists, works, and is proven on the one stitched
full-floor map that IS in the repo, `oracle-seasons-dungeon-backgrounds.png`:

- 24389 cells scanned across 18 bands and 157 blocks, **2181 unique**.
- Output is `assets/tilesets/seasons-dungeons.png` (a 16-column deduplicated
  tileset, frequency-ordered) plus `seasons-dungeons.json`, which records for
  every tile its occurrence count and one map coordinate where it appears.
- `node tools/check-tilesets.mjs` re-runs the ripper and fails unless it is
  byte-identical, and also fails if the manifest loses its frequency counts or
  its ordering.

**The alignment trap, because it will happen again.** The first cut gridded
every band from the image's global content edge and reported 4936 unique tiles.
That number looks like a working deduplicator. It was noise: a stitched sheet
does not align its floors to a common origin, so a floor offset by 8px turns
one wall tile into a family of sixteen. The grid must start at each BLOCK's own
top-left corner — `blocks_in()` finds them by splitting each band on
all-background columns. The honest ratio is 2181/24389, and the most common
tile occurs 1244 times, which is what a wall should look like.

## The 60-tile limit

P7.5 says to stop after the 60 most common tiles per dungeon and log the rest
here. That limit applies to the TILEDEF pass, which has not started — the
tileset and manifest carry all 2181 so the cut can be made against real
frequencies rather than re-ripped. The manifest is already in frequency order,
so "the top 60" is `doc.tiles.slice(0, 60)`.

## Carried over from docs/NEXT-SESSION.md

- **The `cliff` family** — one extraction covers eight tiles and cliffs are on
  most screens. A content decision, not a swap: the Oracles build a cliff from
  several tiles and this game spends one tile on all of it.
- **The `ledge` families** — four directions, nine palette variants each.
- `palm`, `pot`, `sign`, `dBlock`, `dStairs`, `spikes`, `caveMouth`.
- **Water is still hand-drawn** and is genuinely blocked: every terrain sheet
  in the repo is an assembled static map, so there is no second animation frame
  to extract. It needs a sheet that has one.
