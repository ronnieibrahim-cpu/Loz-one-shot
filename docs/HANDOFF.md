# Handoff — Oracle of Tides

State of the project as of this handoff, and what a fresh session needs to know.

## Where things stand

Branch: `claude/zelda-style-game-piqt8v` (everything committed and pushed).

**The engine is complete and verified.** `node tools/test.mjs` boots the game in
headless Chromium and passes 35 assertions covering boot, movement, sword
combat, contact damage, the tide, room transitions, cave warps, the pause menu,
save/load round-tripping, death and respawn. Keep it green.

**`node tools/validate.mjs` is clean** — no problems, only warnings for the
sprite packs still to be drawn.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Engine, renderer, audio, save, menus, cutscene runner | Done |
| Tide system and tide-variant tiles | Done |
| Player, combat, items, enemy framework, boss framework | Done |
| Link sprites | Done — extracted from the Oracle of Ages sheet |
| NPC sprites (9 of 11) | Done — extracted from the Oracle of Seasons sheet |
| Terrain tiles, HUD | Done — hand-drawn |
| **Enemy sprites (56)** | **Done** — extracted from the Oracle of Seasons enemy sheet |
| **Enemy roster (22 types)** | **Done** — `src/data/enemies.js` |
| **Overworld** | **Done — all 120 screens** |
| **Dungeons 1-8** | **Done — 179 rooms, all solvable** |
| Effects + item icons (83) | **Not done** — placeholder boxes |
| Boss/miniboss art (49) | **Poor** — script-generated blobs, needs redraw |
| Boss/miniboss behaviour (16) | **Not started** — `src/data/bosses.js` is a stub |
| Story and dialogue | **Intro only** — the overworld references ~14 unwritten ids |
| Music | 6 tracks, needs about 14 |

### The one thing blocking a playable game

`src/data/bosses.js` is still a stub, so all sixteen boss and miniboss names
spawn nothing. **No dungeon can currently be finished.** This is the highest
value work left. Section G of `docs/briefs/AGENTS.md` specifies it exactly.

## The two documents that matter

- **`docs/GAME-PLAN.md`** — authoritative. Region layout on the 12x10 overworld
  grid, all eight dungeons with their map ids, items, bosses, minibosses,
  overworld entrance screens and tide themes, the item progression table, and
  the damage/HP numbers. Content that disagrees with this is wrong.
- **`docs/ART-DIRECTION.md`** — binding for anything visual. Declares
  `assets/sheets/` the canonical art reference, gives the style rules measured
  from those sheets, and sets the rule: extract when a sheet has it, draw to
  match when it does not. New assets are held to the same standard as extracted
  ones.
- **`docs/briefs/AGENTS.md`** — a complete authoring spec per work area,
  sections A through J. Each section names the one file to edit and how to
  verify. Section J documents the sprite-sheet extraction workflow.

## Tooling

```sh
npm run dev                          # play it at localhost:8080
node tools/validate.mjs              # structural checks, no browser
node tools/validate.mjs --strict     # also fail on unauthored sprites
node tools/validate.mjs --pack=enemies   # scope the sprite-coverage check
node tools/test.mjs --shots          # 35 assertions + screenshots
node tools/preview.mjs enemies --scale=6  # contact sheet of a sprite pack
python3 tools/rip-enemies.py         # regenerate src/data/sprites-enemies.js
```

`test.mjs` and `preview.mjs` take `--shot-dir=` and pick a random port, so
several can run at once.

### Environment setup a fresh container needs

1. `npm install`.
2. Playwright ships a browser revision the pre-installed Chromium does not
   match, so `tools/test.mjs` fails with "Executable doesn't exist". Point the
   expected path at the installed shell rather than downloading a browser:
   ```sh
   cd /opt/pw-browsers
   V=$(ls -d chromium_headless_shell-* | grep -v 1234 | head -1)
   mkdir -p chromium_headless_shell-1234/chrome-headless-shell-linux64
   for f in $V/chrome-linux/*; do
     ln -sf "/opt/pw-browsers/$f" "chromium_headless_shell-1234/chrome-headless-shell-linux64/$(basename $f)"
   done
   ln -sf /opt/pw-browsers/$V/chrome-linux/headless_shell \
     chromium_headless_shell-1234/chrome-headless-shell-linux64/chrome-headless-shell
   touch chromium_headless_shell-1234/{INSTALLATION_COMPLETE,DEPENDENCIES_VALIDATED}
   ```
   (Check the revision `playwright` actually asks for in the error message; it
   was 1234 at the time of writing.)
3. `pip install pillow` if you are going to run any of the `rip-*.py` tools.

## Hard-won lessons — do not rediscover these

**Sprite-sheet extraction** (`tools/ripkit.py`; worked examples in
`tools/rip-link.py`, `tools/rip-npcs.py` and `tools/rip-enemies.py`):

1. Sheets **do not use a uniform row pitch**. Assuming 16px steps cuts every
   sprite in half. `find_cells` measures each sprite's own bounding box.
2. `find_cells` assumes banded art. The **enemy sheet defeats it** — it is a
   mosaic of independently-placed white plates interleaved with label text.
   `rip-enemies.py` segments by flood-filling islands of non-background pixels
   instead and keeps the ones too big to be a glyph.
3. Sprites sit on **white plates**, and `background()` only reports the green
   around them, so the plate quantises as the sprite's lightest colour and every
   creature lands in a white box. Erase only white *reachable from the green* —
   white enclosed by a creature's own outline is artwork.
4. **Find the boxes before erasing the plates.** The plates are what make each
   frame one connected island; stripping first splits sprites apart and
   renumbers every index the frame map refers to.
5. `quantise` pads a short palette by repeating its last colour, which leaves a
   three-colour sprite writing its **outline at index 2**. That renders right in
   the sprite's own palette and wrong in every other, because the game's enemy
   palettes put a mid tone at 2 and the near-black at 3 — so the hard 1px
   outline washes out to grey the moment the roster asks for `enemyg`.
   `normalise_ramp` in `rip-enemies.py` re-slots the ramp.
6. Full-colour sprites need **per-sprite palettes bound to the art** via the
   `{ art, pal }` form. Registering palettes without binding them makes
   everything render in the wrong colours.
7. Packed sheets **leak neighbouring pixels** into a cell; `_trim_slivers`
   drops edge columns disconnected from the sprite body.
8. Always `preview.mjs` the pack and **look at the PNG**. Dimensional validity
   says nothing about whether a sprite reads as the creature it names. Note
   that `preview.mjs` screenshots the canvas clipped to the 1400px viewport, so
   at `--scale=6` the rightmost column is cut off — use `--scale=2` to see a
   whole pack.

**Map authoring:**

- Rooms whose edges must line up are **not** worth hand-checking. Both the
  overworld and the dungeons were authored as 6x8 *interiors* with the border
  ring stamped on from a single shared seam table, which makes "walkable east
  edge implies walkable west edge on the neighbour" true by construction. The
  generators were throwaway scaffolding; the emitted files are the artifact and
  should be edited directly from here on.
- **A doorway needs floor behind it.** An interior authored with its own wall
  run will happily put a wall directly behind a stamped doorway, and the door
  then opens onto stone. Twelve of d2's twenty rooms were unreachable for
  exactly this reason. Carve one tile inward at every doorway.
- **…but that carve must not overwrite a door tile**, or a lock wall sitting on
  the first row behind a doorway is silently punched open.
- **Locked doors go inside rooms, never on a seam.** The engine places an
  arriving player just past the room edge, so a locked tile on a seam drops them
  inside solid stone from the far side. An interior wall with an `L` in it
  splits a room cleanly.
- Room grids are **exactly 8 rows of exactly 10 characters**, and digits 0-9 are
  always tide tiles.

**Engine gotchas already fixed, worth not reintroducing:**

- Input latches key presses, so a tap shorter than one frame still registers.
- Room-exit detection needs a margin wider than one movement step, or exits
  never trigger.
- Warping sets `_warpLock` so arriving on a warp tile does not bounce straight
  back through it.
- The validator rejects a space between two drawn pixels: it is legal in the
  grammar but punches a transparent hole through a sprite.
- Rooms draw a tile by its **tile** name while art is keyed by **art** name, so
  every palette-swap tile (`grassDark` reusing `ART.grass`, and so on) rendered
  as a placeholder box until `installCoreTiles` started aliasing tile names to
  the art they declare. If you add a tile that reuses another's art, that alias
  loop already covers it.

## Verification harnesses

Two throwaway checkers were written for this pass and are worth rebuilding
rather than trusting a read-through. Neither is committed; both are described
well enough here to rewrite in a few minutes.

- **Overworld checker** — imports `src/data/index.js` in plain Node (no
  browser), asserts all 120 screens exist, that every seam's walkable edge tiles
  agree at all three tide levels, that the world border is solid, and that a
  *tile-by-tile* flood from Tidewatch Village reaches every screen. Tile-by-tile
  matters: a screen-level flood misses an interior wall stranding an exit.
- **Dungeon walker** — boots headless, `enterMap`s into every room of every
  dungeon, and checks: no page errors, the room renders, no tile falls through
  to `void`, every entity type in the room resolves, every seam has a doorway
  facing its doorway, and a flood from the entrance — treating locked doors as
  walls until a key is spent, and the boss door until the Boss Key is found —
  reaches every room and the boss room. Deduplicate lock tiles when collecting
  them, or the walk spends several keys on the same door.

## Source sprite sheets are in the repo

The reference sheets live in `assets/sheets/` and are committed, so extractions
are reproducible in any checkout. All three extractors resolve their paths
relative to the repo root and produce byte-identical output to what is
committed. See `assets/sheets/README.md` for what each sheet contains, who
ripped it, and the copyright position.

Sheets present but not yet used: non-human races, trading characters, dungeon
backgrounds, and a fan-made Oracle-style overworld tileset.

## What is left, highest value first

1. **Boss and miniboss behaviour** (`src/data/bosses.js`, brief section G).
   Sixteen types. Nothing can be finished without them.
2. **Effects, pickups, objects, projectiles and item icons** (brief sections A
   and B — `sprites-link.js`, `sprites-world.js`). 83 names still render as
   placeholder boxes, and they are the most-seen art in the game: chests, signs,
   rupees, hearts, the sword slash.
3. **Story and dialogue** (`src/data/story.js`, brief section H). The overworld
   and the village interiors reference dialogue ids that do not exist yet:
   `villager1` `villager2` `villageChild` `digger` `diggerWait` `diggerAfter`
   `shopkeeper` `makuTree` `makuWait` `makuAfter` `faroreHome` `coastFisher`
   `coastChild` `stoneFisher` `wreckSurvivor` `salterElder` `reefFisher`
   `coralDiver` `woodChild` `bogWitch`. An unknown id shows an empty box.
4. **Boss art redraw** (`src/data/sprites-bosses.js`, brief section C).
5. **Music** (`src/data/audio.js`, brief section I).

## Known soft spots in what has been done

- Three overworld region gates do not match GAME-PLAN.md, because no overworld
  tile carries `F.BOMBABLE` and nothing can be gated on the Boomerang or the
  Magnetic Gloves. The Marsh is gated on the tide instead of Bombs, and the Salt
  Pans and Abyssal approach on earlier items. The file header names all three.
  Adding a cracked-cliff tile to `tiles-core.js` plus a `bomb` transform would
  let the Marsh gate match the plan.
- Each of dungeons 5-8 carries one Small Key more than it has locked doors.
- Dungeon room interiors are honest but plain — corridors of pots and tide
  tiles. They are correct and solvable; they are not yet *interesting*. Adding
  `puzzle` blocks and one-way ledges to the middle rooms is cheap now that the
  structure is proved.
